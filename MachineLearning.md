In order to understand Guassian or Normal distribution function we first need to understand what is probability density function. Probability density function (PDF) is defined as a function on some n-dimensional real value that satisfy following constraints:

1. $p(x) \geq 0 ~~~\forall x \epsilon \mathbb{R}^2$ ==> applying PDF on any n-dimensional value should give value greater than equal to 0 
2. $\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}p(x)dx = 1$ ==>  area of under the curve should be equal to 1.

Gaussian distribution function is a PDF that has the following form:

Any function that satisfy above cons

1. Gaussian Distributions
2. Determinant of a NXN Matrix
3. Variance
4. Covariance
	- Is Covariance subject to outlier
	- Can it be more than 1 or less than 1
5. Variance-Covariance Matrix
	1. Symmetric
	2. Positive Definite Matrix
